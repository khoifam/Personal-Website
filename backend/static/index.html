        <h1>Hi, I'm Khoi Pham.</h1>
        <p>I made this website to showcase my works and establish a blank canvas for my future ideas. For a while,  I've been quite interested in explaining advanced computer science concepts with detailed diagrams and an empathy to the learners so that past me wouldn't struggle so bad. Other than that, I mainly work on databases and distributed systems. </p>
